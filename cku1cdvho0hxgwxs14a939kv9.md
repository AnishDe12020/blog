## Deta Space - What is it and why is it the future?

> Disclaimer: This article is not sponsored or biased in any way. I liked the idea behind the product and hence wanted to write about it.

[Deta](https://www.deta.sh/) was a company founded just over 2 years ago and it has been providing free Cloud solutions since.

# What is Deta Space?
Deta Space is a new product from Deta which provides you with your personal cloud hosted by Deta where you can run sandboxed versions of certain apps. It is a relatively new concept but seems to have great potential. Here the developers don't have our data so they cannot sell it. Deta still has our data but in this case, we just need to trust one company rather than trusting a bunch of other companies or developers. You can see Deta's privacy policy [here](https://www.deta.sh/privacy).

# Features

Updates are on an opt-in basis so if you don't want to update to a newer version of an app, you can choose not to. There is no option to downgrade though but that can be added in the future and I hope they do so.

You can also see all the data stored by an app on a per-app basis through Deta's dashboard. To do so, click on the 3-dot menu on the app's icon and click "My Data" and you will be redirected to a page where you can see all the stored data.

# For Developers

Deta Space also provides a marketplace for apps where developers can publish apps. Right now, there are only 5 but as this concept gets more popular and developers start to build more apps compatible with Deta Space, this marketplace is going to expand. You can see the marketplace [here](https://deta.space/discovery).

Deta aims to make it easy for developers to make applications for Deta Space by completely managing the infrastructure from servers, security, data to payments. You can learn more about it [here](https://www.deta.sh/space). 

# How Deta Space can get better

I also see teams using Deta Space as a future use case. Deta Space only supports spaces for individual users now, but later it can be expanded to provide a space that multiple users can access. Also, only one instance of an app can be created currently but the ability to create multiple instances will be a dealbreaker for some.
